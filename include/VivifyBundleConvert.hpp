// On-device Unity AssetBundle platform converter.
//
// Vivify maps ship their assets as a Unity AssetBundle. A bundle built for
// Windows/PCVR cannot be loaded by the Android/ARM64 Unity runtime on Quest:
// UnityEngine.AssetBundle.LoadFromFile either returns null or returns a bundle
// whose GetAllAssetNames() is empty, which is the "the experimental Windows
// bundle doesn't have any assets" symptom.
//
// The part of the bundle that actually makes it platform-specific at *load*
// time is a single int32 -- m_TargetPlatform -- in the header of each
// SerializedFile inside the archive. This converter unpacks the archive,
// rewrites that field to Android, and repacks it uncompressed under a new
// name, so Unity will accept and enumerate it.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT FIX
//   Meshes, prefabs, GameObject hierarchies, animations, animator controllers,
//   audio, text assets and material *definitions* are stored in a
//   platform-independent form and come through intact.
//   Shaders need translating, and ConvertShadersToGles does it: a Windows
//   bundle carries DirectX bytecode, which is cross-compiled to GLSL ES (see
//   VivifyDxbc) and written back into the bundle. A shader using anything
//   outside the translated subset is left as it was and still falls to
//   Vivify's stand-in path (see Runtime::RepairMaterialShader) at load time.
//   Block-compressed textures are not recompressed -- BC/DXT data is not
//   something an Adreno GPU can consume, and re-encoding it to ETC2 or ASTC on
//   a headset is not realistic. Instead each such texture has its m_IsReadable
//   flag set, which is what keeps its CPU copy alive after load so the mod can
//   decode it to RGBA32 at level load (see Runtime::ResolveUsableTexture).
//   Without the flag Unity drops that copy and the decoder is handed an empty
//   buffer, which decodes to solid black.
//
// The implementation is deliberately free of Unity/il2cpp dependencies so it
// can be unit-tested on a host compiler.
