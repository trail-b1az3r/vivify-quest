// DirectX shader bytecode -> GLSL ES, the third and last piece of PC -> Quest
// shader conversion.
//
// A PC Vivify bundle stores its shaders as DXBC: the container Microsoft's
// compiler emits, holding Shader Model 4/5 bytecode plus reflection chunks. A
// Quest cannot run any of it. For OpenGL ES targets Unity does not store a
// binary at all -- the shader blob holds GLSL ES *source text* -- so the output
// side is writable. What is missing is the translation, and that is what lives
// here.
//
// Unity's own cross-compiler (HLSLcc) is roughly thirty thousand lines and is
// not what this is. This is a direct translator for Shader Model 4/5: vertex,
// fragment, geometry and compute programs; every arithmetic, bit-manipulation
// and control-flow instruction including subroutines; the whole sampling family
// with texel offsets, shadow samplers and integer samplers; and structured, raw
// and read/write buffers with their atomics.
//
// What it does not do, in each case because a wrong answer would be worse than
// none: tessellation, double precision, per-sample evaluation, msad,
// append/consume buffers, and a geometry shader that passes a semantic straight
// through. Anything outside the subset fails by name rather than by producing
// plausible-looking wrong GLSL: a shader that does not translate keeps the
// stand-in path it has today, which is a worse look but a working frame.
// Silently emitting a shader that compiles and draws the wrong thing would be
// worse than both.
//
// Everything here is fed untrusted bundle bytes, so every read is bounds-checked
// against the buffer it was handed and every count is validated before it is
// used to size anything.
