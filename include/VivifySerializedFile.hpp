// Minimal Unity SerializedFile reader: enough to find Shader assets inside a
// bundle and report which GPU platforms their compiled programs were built for.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Every shader in a PC-built Vivify bundle has been assumed to carry DirectX
// bytecode and nothing else, which is why converted maps fall back to stand-in
// shading. That assumption was never actually measured -- the converter only
// ever read the SerializedFile *header* (to patch m_TargetPlatform) and never
// looked at a single object. This reads the object table and the Shader assets
// in it, so the claim can be checked against a real bundle instead of asserted.
//
// It is also the piece any real PC->Quest shader conversion has to be built on:
// you cannot rewrite a shader's programs without first being able to locate and
// decode them.
//
// HOW IT WALKS OBJECTS
//
// Unity asset bundles normally embed a type tree -- a per-type description of
// every field, its size, and its nesting. Rather than hardcode Unity 2021.3's
// Shader layout (which changes between versions and would silently misparse the
// moment it shifted), objects are walked using that tree. Two properties make
// this possible without resolving Unity's built-in "common string" table, whose
// exact byte offsets are version-specific:
//
//   - a node carries its own byteSize, and the array flag tells you when the
//     children are [size, element], so the tree can be *traversed* structurally
//     with no type names at all;
//   - field names that matter here ("platforms") are shader-specific, so they
//     live in the file's own local string buffer and always resolve.
//
// Names that resolve only through the common table come back empty; traversal
// is unaffected, which is the point.
//
// Bundles built with DisableWriteTypeTree carry no tree. That is reported
// rather than guessed at.
//
// Unity-free by design, so it is host-testable.

// index into that table. This matches the layout AssetStudio decodes real
// games' shaders with; an earlier version of this reader expected a table at
// the start of every chunk, which only coincides with Unity's layout when a
// group has one chunk.
//
// From Unity 2021.3.10 the table also holds each program's *parameters* --
